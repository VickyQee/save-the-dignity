  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h4 class="number-three"> vision</h4>

  <p>Save the Dignity is a women's charity based in Nigeria that is committed to improving the lives of young girls and women.
     Our organization focuses on providing support to those experiencing homelessness, fleeing domestic violence, or struggling in other ways.
        One of the ways we do this is by distributing period products to women, girls, and anyone who menstruates who may be in need.
       We believe that no one should have to worry about their menstrual needs when they are already facing difficult circumstances.

  <h4>Problem statement:</h4>
     Period poverty is a significant issue in Nigeria, with many women and girls unable to afford or access menstrual products.
     This can lead to absenteeism from school or work, as well as increased risks of infection and other health problems. 
     In addition, there is often a significant amount of shame and stigma surrounding periods, 
     which can further compound the difficulties faced by those in need.</p>

     <h4>Project Description</h4>
     <p>Project description:
     Our Period Pride campaign aims to combat period poverty and end the shame and stigma surrounding periods.
      As part of this campaign, we will be distributing period products to women, girls, and anyone who menstruates who may be in need. 
      We will also be raising awareness about the issue of period poverty and working to destigmatize menstruation through education and outreach efforts.</p>
